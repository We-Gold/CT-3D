# CT-3D

The goal of this project was to learn basic 3D rendering from scratch. It started as a simple marching cubes algorithm (in my Marching-Cubes repository), and I expanded it into 2D and 3D viewers for a series of CT scans. 

This project uses processing for all of the GUIs and rendering.

## 3D Viewer

The 3D viewer implements the marching cubes algorithm in order to create the mesh.
